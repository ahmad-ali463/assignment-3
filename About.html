    <p>Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over?(surar Baqara, Verse 245)</p>
<br>
<p>I HAVE been invited to speak in this assembly on the Message of the Holy Prophet (pbuh). To deal with this subject in the framework of logic, there is one obvious question which arises first: why the message of the Seerat of the Prophet (pbuh), and none other? Why, in particular , that of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and not that of any other Prophets or the founders of other religions? We must deal with this question at the outset. So that our minds may be fully satisfied that we can, in fact, obtain guidance not from any other ancient or modern personality, but from the character and personality of a Messenger of God alone. And of all the Messengers of  God and the leaders of religion, it is the life of Muhammad (pbuh) alone which offers true and comprehensive guidance. Guidance of which we stand in dire need today.</p>
<br>
<p> The Prophet ï·º had a ring made so that he could fulfill the custom of the seal on letters. He could have had any seal made, but he had a beautiful impression created that declared his prophethood and the ultimate oneness of God. We must be elegant in how we present ourselves. Stand tall and with dignity, wear clean, pressed clothes, and exude the beauty of good character.</p>
